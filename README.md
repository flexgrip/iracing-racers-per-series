# iracing-racers-per-series
Just a simple menu panel I made for myself. If you're 100 years old like me (I'm actually only 34), you are set in your ways. So you go to members.iracing.com > Find Official Races > Current Series...  Then you start looking around for how many people are registered in each series.  At this point, you're probably thinking, "But dude, there's already a page that shows that already... All you gotta do is go to Find Official Races > Popular Races Guide." Well, all I can say is, I wish I would have noticed that page before I spent 2 hours dicking around making this extension.  That being said, this extension is cool because it shows you how many people are in each series no matter what iRacing page you are on. But whatever, I figured I'd post it on the Chrome Web Store and Opera Extensions Site just in case.
